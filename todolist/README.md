# Test React Components Using Jest

This is a simple application with several components. 
It lists the tasks in the todo list, enables users to add and delete tasks, and also allows users to toggle the status of the tasks.

## Requirements

* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)

## Running locally

- `git clone` this repo
- `cd testing-react-with-jest`
- `npm install`
- In one tab, run `npm run watch`. This will fire up Webpack and rebuild your app on each change.
- In another tab, run `npm start`. This will fire up a local server that will refresh automatically when the code changes.
- `open http://localhost:8081` to view to the app.

## Tests

Run `npm test` to run the tests with Jest.

Run `npm test -- --watch` to run Jest and have it automatically rerun everytime you change a file.
