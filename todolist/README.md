# Test React Components Using Jest

This is a simple application with several components. 
It lists the tasks in the todo list, enables users to add and delete tasks, and also allows users to toggle the status of the tasks.

## Requirements

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## Setting up environment

- `git clone` this repo
- `cd testing-react-with-jest`
- `npm install`

## Running locally

You need to open two Command Line windows and go to the application folder.

- In one windows, run `npm run watch`. This will fire up Webpack and rebuild your app on each change.
- In another windows, run `npm start`. This will fire up a local server that will refresh automatically when the code changes.
- The browser will automatically open, if not, `open http://localhost:8081` to view to the app.

## Tests

Run `npm test` to run the tests with Jest.

Run `npm test -- --watch` to run Jest and have it automatically rerun everytime you change a file.
