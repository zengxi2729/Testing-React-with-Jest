# Description

In this exercise, you need to mock the "Todo" class and test that the "doneChange" is triggered when "todo" is clicked.

We chose to use enzyme, a testing utility which makes our lifes easier.
You may make use of the mount feature of it to run the test in a headless browser. You may refer to this page for more information: https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme/blob/master/docs/api/mount.md
